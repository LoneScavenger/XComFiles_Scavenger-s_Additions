    Submod for Solarius Scorch's X-COM Files mod
    By Scavenger

===== FAQ =====

 - What does this mod do?
This mod features my custom additions and implements ideas that came to my mind while I was playing X-Com Files.

- Can I use these files for my own mod?
Check the CREDITS file for more info. Otherwise a credit is fine.

 - Why did you make this mod?
In case players don't want the ton of additional weapons from Arsenal Additions mod or the hero units featured in Natasha Morozova join
or in my sync mod, but still like my custom additions - this mod is exactly for them.

 - Is this submod on github?
https://github.com/LoneScavenger/X-Com-File-Scavenger-s-Additions

 - Can I donate to you?
Not yet, but would be great and I'd be very thankful for any donation.

 - Is this mod complete?
There is always something that I come across during gameplay, so do not consider this finished.
More stuff will come as actually make progress in-game.

- Is this mod compatible with other submods?
It is just plain resources, so it should be.
One that it is for sure not compatible with is my Natasha and Arsenal Additions Sync mod, because it already features all these additions.
